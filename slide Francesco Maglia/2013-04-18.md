How to get a json object (representing a cluster of vertices) from MongoDB.

### - Switch coordinates from local to global

The vertices can be stored in json with local coordinates and the aim of this sub-task is to implements the coordinates transformation.

#Problem Solution

### - Retrieve json from MongoDB

A json file contains fields that can be queried to obtain the correct cluster. The field involved in this transaction is "id". Every id is a key generated by the spatial partitioner to describe the spatial position of the cluster. This action is performed by querying MongoDB.

### - Switch coordinates from local to global

The cluster vertices are stored in the field "vertices" of the json. The field contains an array of array containing the vertex coordinates. Every internal array contains a coordinate for each spatial dimension. In this example is shown a 3D array of vertices.
ex. "vertices":[
 				[ 2., 2., 2.],
     				[−2.,−2., 2.],
     				[−2., 2.,−2.],
     				[ 2.,−2.,−2.]
		]

The spatial transformation (from local coordinates to global) is performed through the multiplication between every vertex with a matrix representing the spatial transformation. This information is stored in the field "vertices_transformation".
