## Model

Model provides the description o a Model inside the system
Clusters_tree describe how a model is divided in different clusters. It is an emebedded tree representation of how the space is divided, where only the leaf are Clusters

```javascript
{
	"type": "model",
	"id": //text, unique model id
	"name": //text,
	"description": //text,
	"dimensions": [
			[//first dimension min, //first dimension max],
			[//secons dim min, //second dim max],
		],
	"clusters": [//cluster id, //cluster id, ... , //cluster id],
	"clusters_tree": //recursively: tree:= leaf | '[' tree* ']' ; leaf:= cluster id. it represent a tree
}
```

## Cluster
A Cluster describe a set of contiguous cells not shared with other clusters. No Cluster intersecate with another Cluster (they do not share vertices)

```javascript
{
	"id": //text, key generated by the spatial partitioner to describe the spatial position of this cluster
	"type": "cluster"// value to differentiate between "cluster" and "inter_cluster" 
	"vertices_transformation": [[,,,],[,,,],[,,,],[,,,]] //optional: a 2d square matrix of (#model_dimensions + 1) rows/colums, used to transform the vertices to the global model coords system. if it is the identity matrix it can be omitted (this happens when there is no transformation when building the clusters from the model)
	"vertices": [
		[//0° coord, //1°coord, ... //n°coord]//0° vertex,
		[]//1° vertex
		[]//2° vertex
		.
		.
		[]//last vertex
	],
	"v_attributes":[
		[//0°attr, ..., //k°attr]//0° vertex's attribute - data source dependent - could be a color, density
		[]//1° vertex's attr
		.
		.
		[]//last vertex attr
	],//this is optional, but probably will be often present
	"cells": [
		[//vertex index, //vertex index, ... //last vertex index]//0° face, 
		[],
		[],
		.
		.
		[]//last face
	], //max order cells. for a 3d model each face is composed of 4 veritices
	"adjacent_clusters": [//first cluster id, .., //last cluster id]	//how to define an adjacent cluster? simpler answer: an adjacent cluster share a cell with this cluster 
	"interdomain_clusters": [ //0° interdomain_cluster id, //1° interdomain_cluster id , .., //last interdomain cluster id] // this attribute exists to describe the cells that lie between two or more clusters
}
```

## InterDomain Cluster

InterDomain Cluster describe those cells that are shared between Clusters (each cell has at least one vertex in each one of the parent clusters). Vertices an v_attributes are emebedded in this document for ease of representation 

```javascript
{
	"id": //text, key generated by the spatial partitioner to describe the parents of this cluster
	"type": "inter_cluster"// "cluster" or "inter_cluster" - value to differentiate between schema
	"parent_clusters": [//first cluster id, .., //last cluster id],
	"vertices": [
		[//0° coord, //1°coord, ... //n°coord]//0° vertex,
		[]//1° vertex
		[]//2° vertex
		.
		.
		[]//last vertex
	],
	"v_attributes":[
		[//0°attr, ..., //k°attr]//0° vertex's attribute - data source dependent - could be a color, density
		[]//1° vertex's attr
		.
		.
		[]//last vertex attr
	],//this is optional, but probably will be often present
	"cells": [
		[//vertex index, //vertex index, ... //last vertex index]//0° face, 
		[],
		[],
		.
		.
		[]//last face
	], //max order cells. for a 3d model each face is composed of 4 veritices
}
```

# Example values

This is an example of a valid cluster, describing a single tetrahedron

```javascript
{
	"id": "0000001",
	"type": "cluster", 
	"vertices_transformation": [[1.0,  0,  0,  0],
	 							[  0,1.0,  0,  0],
	 							[  0,  0,1.0,  0],
	 							[  0,  0,  0,1.0]],
	"vertices":[
				[ 2., 2., 2.],
    			[−2.,−2., 2.],
    			[−2., 2.,−2.],
   				[ 2.,−2.,−2.]
   			],
	"v_attributes":[
				[0.5, 0.8],
				[28.44, 3.],
				[28.44, 3.],
				[3.4, 0.]
			],
	"cells":[
				[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
			],
	"adjacent_clusters": [],
	"interdomain_clusters": []
}
```
