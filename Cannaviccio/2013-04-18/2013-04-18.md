### Cluster Visualization
- - -
## Problem description
The aim of this task is to display large clusters of dots forming a "cancellous bone". 
The development of this application has been divided into two parts. The first concerns the back-end application, 
and includes the interface to the database (MongoDB) in which are stored all the clusters of points. 
MongoDb is the common point to all members of the group, through which each participant in the project can "communicate" with the rest of the team.

The second part of the task has as its purpose the visualization of cluster via the web browser. In order to make the work more complete, 
statistics were done to compare the computational load that can withstand the technologies pyPlasm and plasmJs.
## Architecture
As described above the point of contact between members of the project is represented by the database. In order to make the project the most powerful, scalable, and efficient as possible we opted for an architecture based on NodeJs. This server uses an asynchronous event-driven, non-blocking I / O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. 
To interface the server that runs the application services with MongoDb was used MongoJs interface. This module allows a fast and efficient use of the insert and retrieve functions on large amounts of data.
The exchange of messages between client and server has been run through the Socket.io module.Socket.io aims to make realtime apps possible in every browser and mobile device, blurring the differences between the different transport mechanisms.

To implement the visualization has been used mainly JavaScript language, using the development environment Plasm.js. In addition, tests were performed using the Python module PyPlasm.

## Visualization
The objective of the second part of the application is to display the clusters of the model. The input of this phase is the JSON cluster that should be displayed.
