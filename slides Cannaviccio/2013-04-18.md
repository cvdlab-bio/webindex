## Problem description

### Vertices trasformation and visualization
A cluster describes a set of contiguous cells not shared with other clusters.
The representation of cluster is stored in JSON file. The fields of JSON represent the description of the composition of a single cluster.
A cluster is formed by a group of vertices. In the JSON file there are informations about the position and the attributes for each vertices. There are also informations about the vertices that form a single cell.
The aim of this sub-task is apply the transformations for single vertices and the visualization on screen of the cluster.

## Problem solution

###Vertices trasformation
The JSON files that represent the clusters are organized in fields. 
- Vertices are represented by an array of arrays that show the coordinates of points (two for 2D model, three for 3D model).

#### 
              "vertices": [ [2, 2, 2] , 
                            [−2,−2, 2] , 
                            [−2.5, 2.8,−2.3] , 
                            [1.2,−1.7,0] 
              ];

- Vertices attributes are represented by an array of arrays that show the values of COLOR and BRIGHTNESS of single point.

####
              "v_attributes": [ [0.5, 0.8] ,
                                [28.44, 3] , 
                                [28.44, 3] , 
                                [3.4, 0] 
              ];

- Cells are also rappresented by an array of arrays containing the indexes of the vertices for max order cells.
  (for a 3D model each cell is composed by 4 vertices)

####
              "cells": [ [0, 1, 2, 3] ];

The function apply each attribute to the vertex in order.

###Visualization

After the transformation of vertices and the organization in cells, the cluster can be visualized. The input of the function is the cluster's ID and the output is the viewing of the model using plasm.js library.
