### Cluster Visualization
- - -
## Problem description
The aim of this task is to display large clusters of dots forming a "cancellous bone". 
The development of this application has been divided into two parts. The first concerns the back-end application, 
and includes the interface to the database (MongoDB) in which are stored all the clusters of points. 
MongoDb is the common point to all members of the group, through which each participant in the project can "communicate" with the rest of the team.
